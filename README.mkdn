Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/CyanogenMod, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

For *buntu you need this packages:

sudo apt install repo maven m4 openjdk-8-jdk schedtool curl

To initialize your local repository using the CyanogenMod and my trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/hersche/android.git -b cm-13.0

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
    
Then init enviroment:

    source build/envsetup.sh

Then build it:

    brunch cm_mt6582-userdebug
    
In the end, replace the boot.img-file via Sp-Flashtools or by replacing in zip with one from ported roms.


Please see the [CyanogenMod Wiki](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/) for building instructions.
